# JoblySQLDatabase
This is the repository of the SQL scripts made for a Project in the Databases Class.
The specific database engine used for the proyect (and the class) is SQL Server

## The participants in the proyect were:
- David Betancur
- Pablo Garcia
- Nicolas Gutierrez
- Sebastian Ruiz
- Santiago Yepes (me)

Although we were a group, I'll mostly only put the scripts I made of the project to not make it unnecesarily long, this because each step of the project was equitatively distributed, so each of contributed to each part, so for example, we had to make 10 querys, so each of us made 2, or if we had to make 10 ddl triggers and 10 dml triggers, each of us made 2 and 2; thats why I am only including what I did, otherwise it would be unnecesarily long.

# Description
The proyect is about a database for a theoretical application for getting jobs, kind of a linkedin, were companies (or people, called employers) listed some jobs, and then other people (providers) would join the offering hoping to get elected for a contract.

The providers could add extra information and certifications.

And the employers could make chats with the providers they deem interesting, to decide wether to make a contract with them or not.

# What the repository includes
The repository includes all the steps parts of the proyect we made, from the initial entity relationship diagram, to the querys.

### Notes: 
* Theres a lot of things in spanish since although I love english, we still in Colombia.
* Not including the logic diagram since the visual diagram of the database is more up to date, and provides more information (in my opinion).
* Will include the sql query for the database instead of the whole database as a .bac file, that way there may be less problems with SQL server versions (or if not in SQLserver, run the creation querys directly).
